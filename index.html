											<h2>Intro</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my corner of the internet. When I'm not working 
										   💼, I love playing with nail art 💅 and creating beautiful henna designs 
										   🌸. It's fun to bring a bit of beauty into everyday life with colors and 
										   patterns. My love for these arts is just like my love for travel 🌍 – both 
										   let me explore and enjoy different styles and scenes.<br><br>I've got quite the 
										   travel bug 🐞. I've been all over Canada 🇨🇦, from British Columbia to Ontario, 
										   and I've seen most of the United States too – 41 states, to be exact! I’ve 
										   also been lucky enough to visit Dubai 🕌 and Pakistan 🇵🇰. Every place has its 
										   own story, and I bring a little piece of each adventure back home with me. 
										   <br><br>Family time is precious to me 💖. We love going on road trips 🚗, just packing 
										   up and seeing where the road takes us. And when I need a little me-time, I hop 
										   on my bicycle 🚲. It’s just me and the open road, and it’s the best feeling.<br><br> 
										   I’m also a huge fan of Korean TV shows 📺. Have you seen "Crash Landing on 
										   You"? I can't get enough of it!<br><br>In the world of front-end development, I bring 
										   all these experiences together. Crafting websites 🖥️ that are not only functional 
										   but also beautiful and user-friendly is my specialty. I'm passionate about building 
										   digital spaces that people love to use, making sure every pixel is in perfect harmony 
										   with the user's needs.<br><br>So, stay a while and explore 🌐. I'm here to share the coding 
										   projects that excite me 🤓 and the personal passions that inspire me. Every line of code, 
										   like life, is part of a bigger picture, and I'm here to make it both meaningful and 
										   memorable. 🌟<br><br></p>

										<h3>🎨 Etch-A-Sketch 🖌️</h3>
										<p>The Etch-A-Sketch Application turns your web browser into a limitless 
											canvas for creativity. It starts with a key step - the “Resize” button, 
											which lets you re-size your drawing area. This unlocks the app's full 
											potential, revealing five tools to inspire your imagination. You can 
											pick from three vibrant colors (black, grey, and rainbow), use the eraser 
											to fix mistakes, and hit clear to start over. Whether you're a beginner 
											or an experienced artist, this app offers a simple yet powerful set of tools 
											to create digital art.</p>
										<p>Tools used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>

										<h3>📚 Library 📖</h3>
										<p>The Library application is a web application that helps 
											you organize and manage your book collection. It's designed 
											to make cataloging your books easy and intuitive. With the 
											"Add Book" feature, you can quickly enter details like the 
											book's title, author, page count, and your reading progress. 
											You can then choose to save the entry, creating a visually 
											appealing card for each book, or cancel if you need to. These 
											book cards are not just informative but also interactive, 
											letting you update your reading progress or remove books 
											from your collection with ease. This project shows how simplicity 
											and efficiency can improve digital library management.</p>

										<p>The Calculator Web Application is a simple and stylish tool that makes doing 
											math easier. It has a clean and easy-to-use interface, with all the basics 
											you need - number buttons, basic math operations, a clear button, and an 
											equal sign to get your answer. You can easily type in numbers and operations, 
											then press the equal sign to see the result right on the screen. This project 
											shows how you can combine functionality and design to create a useful and 
											user-friendly tool for everyday math tasks.</p>
